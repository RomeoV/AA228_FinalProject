* Calibrating Black-Box Transition Models For MDP Planning Using Conformal Prediction

#+begin_quote
In this paper, we study the application of Conformal Prediction to the calibration of black-box transition models for
planning in a Markov Decision Process setting. Successful deployment of this method frees us from having to make
distributional assumptions on the underlying problem, which
often leads to poor calibration, and can provide statistical
guarantees, particularly relevant for safety-critical applications.
Drawing inspiration from Composite Quantile Regression, we propose an alternative formulation of the Bellman equation, to be used with existing algorithms such as
value iteration. Also, we show that we can tighten the approximation error arbitrarily tightly. Using our experimen-
tal setup, we find that policies based on our method have the
ability to outperform other strategies, and the temperature
scaling recalibration technique. Specifically, our method
consistently achieves a higher discounted reward, and is more
robust against a shift in the underlying distribution.

*** TLDR: Rewriting Bellman Equation using "Conformalized" Model.
Consider the Bellman equation
#+begin_src math
U(s) = \max_a \left( R(s, a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{s' \sim T(s' \mid s, a)} U(s') \right).
#+end_src
In this project, we consider miscalibrated transition models
#+begin_src math
T: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow [0, 1]^{S},
#+end_src
conformalize them as
#+begin_src math
\mathcal{C}_\lambda (T): \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S}),
#+end_src
and then propose appropriate ways to compute the expectations, e.g.
#+begin_src math
\mathbb{E}_{x \sim f_X} g(x) \approx \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \left( w_\lambda \cdot \mathit{mean}_{x \in [\mathcal{C}_\lambda \circ f_X]} g(x) \right).
